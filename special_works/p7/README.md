**Scenario**

An art studio is doing an installation on the intersection of art and science with a focus on geospatial information.
One of the most important concepts in GIS is the accurate portrayal of spatial data projected in the 2-dimensional plane.
This fundamental to our ability to answer questions such as "how far away" or "how large of an area" something is.

You have been requested to produce two maps displaying the same spatial data: one in the geographic coordinate system, WGS84, and one in a projected coordinate system that you design.

**Basic Level**

To fulfill the basic level, you need to create two map layouts of the same spatial data---it may be raster or vector---making certain to adhere to the qualities of good map-making (see [Essential Map Elements & Criteria for a Good Map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YJLVqjymizmohNtvntoBoNYwtsQHTdRnM3MIFeJNQwE/edit?usp=sharing)).
Your maps should also match in scale and extent and employ visualizing interesting symbology (this is a submission to an art gallery, after all).
Label your coordinate reference systems.

**Intermediate Level**

Create a custom projection for your data.
Use an existing projection as your foundation and change values to see how it impacts your map.
Keep track of the values you change and take note of the changes and why they are occurring.
Give your new projection a name.

**Advanced Level** (_GIS 520_)

Create an abstract projection for your data.
Really try to make an abstract visualization of your data using the mathematics of projections and transformations.

Submit your layouts and your projection definition, including a short summary of your inspiration and how your projection/transformation works.
