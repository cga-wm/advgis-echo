# Special Works - Project 1 - Figure Reproduction
[Introduction (.mp3)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ANKF3Ok3XjZDk65PbpGexf3mPCSH1uaz/view)

A client has asked you to reproduce a figure that they found in a journal article they read.
Unfortunately, they only provide you with the following details:

* __Journal Title__: Geoscientific Model Development
* __Article Title__: Simple process-led algorithms for simulating habitats (SPLASH v.1.0): robust indices of radiation, evapotranspiration and plant-available moisture
* __Figure__: Fig. 3

I spoke with the first author and they told me that the figure was originally produced using QGIS and that the basemap was designed using a K&ouml;ppen-Geiger climate classification dataset.

**Basic Level**

1. Find the figure that needs to be reproduced
1. Find/create the spatial data represented in the figure
1. Recreate the visualization as close as possible to the one that's published (including the layout and caption)
1. Keep note of all the procedures, datasets, references, and changes from the original
